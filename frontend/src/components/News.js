            <h1>Apple iOS</h1>
            <p>Apple announces new privacy features: During its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple unveiled a range of new privacy features that will be introduced in the upcoming iOS 15 operating system. One notable feature is Mail Privacy Protection, which shields users' IP addresses and prevents senders from tracking email opens. This ensures greater privacy for users and reduces the amount of data shared with advertisers. Additionally, Apple introduced iCloud+, an upgraded subscription service that includes enhanced privacy features such as Private Relay, which encrypts users' internet traffic and makes it more difficult for third parties to track their browsing activity. These new privacy-focused updates highlight Apple's commitment to safeguarding user data and giving individuals more control over their digital footprint.</p>
